The textile industry illustrates in textbook style how 
producers of relatively undifferentiated goods in capital 
intensive businesses must earn inadequate returns except under 
conditions of tight supply or real shortage.  

As long as excess 
productive capacity exists, prices tend to reflect direct 
operating costs rather than capital employed.  


Such a supply-
excess condition appears likely to prevail most of the time in 
the textile industry, and our expectations are for profits of 
relatively modest amounts in relation to capital.




     We hope we donâ€™t get into too many more businesses with such 
tough economic characteristics.  


But, as we have stated before: 

(1) our textile businesses are very important employers in their 
communities, 

(2) management has been straightforward in reporting 
on problems and energetic in attacking them, 

(3) labor has been 
cooperative and understanding in facing our common problems, 

and 
(4) the business should average modest cash returns relative to 
investment.  


As long as these conditions prevail - and we expect 
that they will - we intend to continue to support our textile 
business despite more attractive alternative uses for capital.
